# Habitat 
Habitat is an on-campus dormitory management application available on two platforms. The iOS application focuses on tracking individual student expenses, providing university news, and offering alternative bank payment options for students. The web application serves as a management system, allowing staff to monitor expenses, manage dormitory rooms across different buildings, and address student concerns. Additionally, the petition feature enables students to report issues, such as excessive noise from certain rooms, for prompt resolution.

## üóÉÔ∏è Problem Statement: 
The dormitory at Assumption University is one of the preferred choices for students as it is conveniently located within the university campus, making it easy for them to attend classes. Additionally, the university provides various facilities for students, such as study rooms, a sports center, and a library.

There are three dormitory buildings: King Solomon, King David, and Queen of Sheba. Currently, dormitory management is handled manually, requiring onsite supervision, which increases the workload and paperwork for managers. This manual process often leads to errors in expense calculations and document management, particularly in billing. Tenant bills must be sent manually, and there is no centralized system for maintaining clear records of expenses, the total number of rooms in each building, or financial statements. These records are crucial for effective management, and having real-time access to them would greatly improve operational efficiency.
## üìà Objective
Many students have expressed concerns about the price, services, and management system of the on-campus dormitory. To address these issues, we are developing the Habitat project. Currently, dormitory staff manage operations manually, relying on a paper-based system to record and verify documents related to expenses, rooms, and student accommodations. As a result, students residing in the dormitory often face difficulties in accurately checking their bills.
